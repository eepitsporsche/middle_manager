## Description
The Middle Manager is a content managment system which provides users with an easy-to-use program to create and maintain a database of employee information. User input taken from a series of prompts is applied to tables within the database. The program utilizes Inquirer to register user input and MySQL2 to create and modify the database with the user responses.

Future development for this app would include functions to delete table data and implement a feature to view salary budgeting data.


## Installation
* [Inquirer v8.2.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) must be installed to operate this app.

## Usage
[Clone the repository](https://github.com/eepitsporsche/middle_manager) to your machine and open the application in VS Code.

After answering the prompts, an SVG file entitled "logo.svg" with the user's response parameters applied will be created.
Opening the file via the live server will allow you to view the generated logo.svg.
